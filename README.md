# CarsDekho Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing car sales data from the CarsDekho platform. The dataset provides detailed information about vehicles, such as their models, manufacturing year, selling price, fuel type, and mileage. Using SQL queries, we derive insights into sales trends, car availability by year, and other valuable metrics for the automobile industry.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following key attributes:

- **Name**: The model and variant of the car.
- **Year**: Year of manufacture.
- **Selling Price**: Price at which the car is sold.
- **km_driven**: Kilometers the car has been driven.
- **Fuel**: Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/Electric, etc.).
- **Seller Type**: Individual or Dealer.
- **Transmission**: Manual or Automatic.
- **Owner**: Ownership status (First Owner, Second Owner, etc.).
- **Mileage**: Fuel efficiency.
- **Engine**: Engine capacity (in CC).
- **Max Power**: Maximum power output.
- **Torque**: Torque specifications.
- **Seats**: Number of seats.

## SQL Queries
The repository includes a SQL script (`Cars Dekho Sales Data analysis.sql`) with queries that perform tasks such as:

- Counting the total number of cars.
- Analyzing car availability for specific years.
- Grouping cars by their year of manufacture.
- Aggregating data to observe trends in selling prices and mileage.

## Getting Started
To use this project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cars-dekho-sales-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Setup the database**:
   - Use the provided SQL script to create and populate the `Cars` database.
   - Run the queries to explore the dataset and gain insights.

3. **Explore the dataset**:
   - Open the CSV file (`Car dekho.csv`) to understand the data structure.
   - Modify or expand the SQL queries for deeper analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: For data analysis and querying.
- **Pandas (optional)**: For additional data manipulation in Python.
- **CarsDekho dataset**: Source of data.

## Key Insights
Examples of insights derived from this project include:

- The number of cars available for sale by year.
- Mileage trends for different car models.
- Variations in selling price based on fuel type or transmission.

## Future Enhancements
- Include Python scripts for advanced data visualization and analytics.
- Add machine learning models to predict selling prices or car demand trends.
